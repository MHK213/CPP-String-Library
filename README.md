# Title:
C++ String Library Project

# Description:
This project is a custom C++ string manipulation library that encapsulates advanced string operations inside a reusable class called clsString.
It serves as a mini replacement and enhancement to <string> by providing extended utilities for analyzing, transforming, 
and formatting text while practicing object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, static methods, and abstraction.
I relied on OOP concepts such as encapsulation, static methods, and abstraction.
Functions are divided into two types: instance methods that can only be accessed via an object, 
and static methods that can be accessed via Clsstring::FunctionName().
The logic is implemented from scratch and does not rely on pre-defined functions in the String library.

# Some Functions Used:
- Split String
- Trim Left, Trim Right, Trim
- Join String
- Reverse Words
- Replace Words
- Remove Pounctuations

# Learning Objectives:
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Differentiate between static and instance methods
- Use encapsulation effectively
- Build modular and reusable C++ libraries
- Practice clean code design


This project is part of my personal learning journey.
